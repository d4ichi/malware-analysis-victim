# Victim Environment for Malware Analysis
I created templete of ToDo list to build comfortable victim environment to infected by malware for behavioral analysis & reverse engineering.
I normally install these on Virtual Machine on VMware Workstation.

This is a list of efficient tools or software for victim environment on malware analysis.
Some of them are essential, others thought are not so important actually.
